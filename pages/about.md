## About the Collection

This collection offers examples of several stitches usd in crochet, ranging from from beginner to intermediate difficulty. This wesbite serves as a digiital companion to the physical collection which is housed at the Scott Community College Library in Bettendorf, IA. 

## Collection History

This collection started as a project for an Information Organization class at the University of Iowa to learn about metadata. The physical objects used in this collecion are now available as reference items at Scott Community College. In March of 2025, teh creator of this collection and two other employees at Scott Community College started up a crafting club at SCC.
